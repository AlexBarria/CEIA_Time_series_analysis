The final assessment's theme was try to predict the oil content in soybean meal at the exit of one equipment called Extractor. This type of equipment are largely used in the edible oil industry.

The motivation to study this variable is that's a direct measurement of how good the extraction process was did it.

In this work I carried out an exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical tests to know if the series was stationary and I tried statistical models (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM).

In the next figures we can see some plots included in the EDA and the forecasting using ARIMA and a LSTM model.
